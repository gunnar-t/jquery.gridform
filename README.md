jquery.gridform
===============
## Management summary
JQuery-Plugin for creating complex forms (table-based) with usage of bootstrap and (optional) Font-Awesome.


## Introduction
Why a new plugin for building html forms? Because I was tired of building (complex) forms by hand and needed
some lib for my projects that could handle the following:

 * Display a bunch of form elements in a (sometimes) complex grid
 * Have an "edit" and a "view" mode
 * Simple add validation or other event handler on form elements
 * Use the excellent bootstrap design and optional font awesome for "nicer" form ui
 * Have the ability to use elements spanning over some rows of the grid (rowspan and colspan)
 * Use it with Semantic UI or Bootstrap
 * Add types very easy with addType method

Since I did not find a library doing all that in a kindly manner: I did it myself :)
The code was done in three days in my sparetime, so I am sorry for all the mess and all the bugs that are still in there.
